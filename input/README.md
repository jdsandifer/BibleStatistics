# Encodings
Part of the work of creating this project was formatting the text I was given so that it could more easily be parsed. 
The text was given to me in UTF8 format with a significant amount of "special" characters 
(e.g. slanted parentheses that are different at each end) and different characters fulfilling the same role - sometimes 
verse markings had a standard colon between the chapter and verse numbers and other times it was 
a different character that looked like a colon.

I also didn't know what exact encoding I was getting as I converted the Word document I was given into basic text. 
I created several files in different formats to compare with my converted files and help me setup the initial input 
of the text.
